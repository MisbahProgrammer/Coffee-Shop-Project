        <p className='text-xl md:text-2xl text-center w-[90%] md:w-[70%] mb-5 mx-auto'>I had a fantastic experience at this coffee shop! The cappuccino was rich, creamy, and had the perfect balance of flavor. The chai latte was absolutely delightful, with a warm and soothing blend of spices. I also tried the macchiato, which was smooth and had just the right amount of sweetness. The espresso, with its bold and strong flavor, was a great pick-me-up. The shop itself has a cozy, welcoming atmosphere, and the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. With such a wide variety of drinks to choose from, Iâ€™m definitely looking forward to my next visit!</p>
